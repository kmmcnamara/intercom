I'm using this README to talk about the answer to Question 1, and also to go over how to run my answers to Questions 2 and 3

1) I think my proudest achievement is creating a tool that allows people to dispute incorrect information on their credit report. I've always been motivated by working on things that make a tangible difference in people's lives and this is something that definitely did. We set out to create an experience that lets people interact with their credit report in an intuitive way and really take control of their finances, and to date it has helped remove over $7b of people's debt. Seeing that kind of result from something I've built is really humbling, and I'm happy to have helped provide that kind of relief.

2) For both this and 3) you'll need to clone this repo. To see the results for this, just run `php InviteToDrinks.php` from inside this directory

3) This is similar to 2), to see all events run `php GetCalendar.php`. I've included the options `--before, --after, --at_least, and --at_most`. `--before` and `--after` take a date in the format like "1/2/2015". `--at_least` and `--at_most` just take a number. You can use any of these in combination as well.

Thanks!
